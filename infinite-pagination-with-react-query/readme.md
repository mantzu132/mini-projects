Bidirectional Infinite Scroll Image Gallery using TanStack Query library and react-intersection. It fetches and displays images from a mock API. 

Custom scroll direction detection mechanism is integrated, enabling the application to distinguish between user-initiated scrolls and automatic scrolls caused by content loading. 

Users can remove images from the gallery (only they will see the changes)
